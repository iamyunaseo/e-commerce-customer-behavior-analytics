This study aims to not only analyze the customer purchase patterns, but also predict their behavior. Using these insights, I strive to build a recommendation system - item based collaborative filtering to enhance user engagement and identify potential purchases.\n","\n","Conducting customer segmentation will be based on RFM(Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) and K-Means Algorithm. The RFM anallysis is executed using transactional dataset for evaluating customers on their purchase behavior. And K-Means is used to identify inherent clusters emerge from the data. This identification will be helpful to set important strategy such as suggesting special offers and products by their segment.\n","\n","I especially built an item-based collaborative filtering with these reasons. First of all, the dataset has a large number of transactional records with CustomerID - Item - Timestamp structure, while doesn't have much user profile info. However, it has enough data on what users purchased, enabling to interpret, \"Customers who bought X also bought Y.\"\n","\n","\n","\\\\"],"metadata":{"id":"yUQQ0SosnwMS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#1.

When customers buy multiple items in a single transaction, each item generates a separate row with the same invoice number and date, which can disrupt the calculation of exact mean values. For example, referring to the table below, CustomerID '18282' appears to have an average interval of 9.83 days between purchases. However, this customer made only three unique transactions on 08/05/2011, 08/09/2011, and 12/02/2011, which can't be 9.833 days of average interval.
